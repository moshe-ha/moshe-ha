## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love problem solving, and if I canâ€™t find the solution, I will find someone who can, learn from it and continue to grow further in my endeavors. 

My goal is to be a jack of all trades and a master of none, because I feel that is better than a master of one. 

I aim to understand enough of a system that I can collaborate with almost anyone and learn more as I need on the way.
